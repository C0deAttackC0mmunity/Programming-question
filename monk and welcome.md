#                  Monk and Welcome Problem

<b>Having a good previous year, Monk is back to teach algorithms and data
structures. This year he welcomes the learners with a problem which he
calls "Welcome Problem". The problem gives you two arrays A and B (each
array of size N) and asks to print new array C such that: C[i] = A[i] + B[i]; 1<=
i<= N

Now, Monk will proceed further when you solve this one. So, go on and
solve it :)**

## Input Format

First line consists of an integer N, denoting the size of A and B.

Next line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.

Next line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array B.

## Output Format

Print N space separated integers denoting the array C.

## Constraints

1<= N <=1000001<= A[i] <= 100000; 1<= i<= N

1<= B[i] <= 100000; 1<= i<= N
